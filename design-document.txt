Why a Winery Project?

The country where I currently live has deep roots in winemaking, so choosing a winery as the theme felt natural. It’s a competitive niche, full of beautifully crafted landing pages from real wineries — which creates the perfect environment to stand out by comparison and by quality.
This project wasn’t just about building another polished landing page. It was a chance to demonstrate:
my ability to design from scratch,
my aesthetic judgment,
and my skill in translating a concept into a digital experience that feels intentional.

Choosing the Style

When you think winery website, the usual imagery appears almost automatically:
white, textured backgrounds
parchment-like paper
burgundy accents
serif fonts
gold foil effects
grape leaves here and there
an overall “premium but traditional” feel
In other words:
a cliché, but a well-established one.

At this point I had two possible approaches:

Option A — Follow the cliché
Recreate the traditional winery aesthetic to prove I can execute a design within existing conventions and replicate established high-end patterns.

Option B — Redefine the aesthetic
Break from the norm, reimagine the winery theme through my own lens, and show that I can:
shape a visual identity from my own imagination,
build a design system live as I create,
and deliver something that feels modern, atmospheric, and recognizably mine.
I chose Option B.

Why 50s Jazz Noire?

When I explored which feeling usually these sites try to trigger, which is obviously "clean luxury" and "rustic heritage", they did miss the other, vital, I'd even say crucial part of the wine as a culture - 
a mood, a frame of mind, a story. There emerged the idea for 50s jazz noire, cinematic medium for wine as a story. 
Instead of grapes, parchment, and predictable serif logos, jazz-noir brings:
cinematic lighting
moody contrast
soft smoke-like gradients
nostalgic textures
a sense of story and character

It creates uniqueness without forcing gimmicks.

It’s premium without being pretentious.
It’s classic without being cliché.
